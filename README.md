# ASV_Interface
Internet based controller for JavaASV
https://github.com/mabster314/JavaASV


This project was created as a way of editing configuration files though a nice webpage. 

It has been tested with a Raspberry PI running Apache 2. The javaASV repo must be located in the same location as these files.
